    This function always returns 0. It will throw an error if any of the
    values are outside of the 0-255 range.

    By default, themes are set

	How these codes are used in-game is up to the wizard, but the
	intended/initial use cases are highlighted byt he choice of
	arguments names above.

	These colors correspond respectively to T_HIGH, T_LIGHT, T_NORM,
	T_DARK, and T_VDARK pinkfish codes.

    This efun is only defined if ANSI_COLOR was defined at compile time.
