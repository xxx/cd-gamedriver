NAME
	hash_string - Get a hexadecimal hash digest of a string

SYNOPSIS
	string hash_string(string str, int algorithm)

DESCRIPTION
	This function takes 'str' as input, and hashes it to a hexadecimal
	string with 'algorithm', which is defined as follows:

	    0  -  MD5
	    1  -  SHA1
	    2  -  SHA256
	    3  -  SHA384
	    4  -  SHA512

EXAMPLES
        hash_string("foobar", 1)
            returns "8843d7f92416211de9ebb963ff4ce28125932878"

NOTES
        It's probably best to not use these for anything requiring real
        security. They are better than the classic LPC crypt() function,
        but are still pretty easily brute-forced on modern hardware, or
        will be sooner than later.
