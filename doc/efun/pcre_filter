NAME
    pcre_filter - filter a list for strings that match a given Perl-compatible
                  regular expression

SYNOPSIS
    string *pcre_filter(string *strs, string pattern)

DESCRIPTION
    Returns all members of strs that match pattern, which is a regular
    expression, as defined by libpcre2 (https://www.pcre.org/).

    This function has the same semantics as regexp(), but matches against
    PCRE's instead.

    Returns an array of matching strings.

    This function is not defined unless HAVE_PCRE is defined at build time.

NOTES
    Using this function is preferred over something like
    filter(strs, &pcre_matches(,pattern)), as this function compiles the regexp
    only 1 time, compared to once per call to pcre_matches() 

SEE ALSO
    pcre_matches, pcre_capture, regexp
