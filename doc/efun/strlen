NAME
	strlen - give the length of a string

SYNOPSIS
	int strlen(int|string str)

DESCRIPTION
	Gives the length of a string in number of characters. If an integer
	is passed as an argument then 0 is returned.

	When ANSI_COLOR is defined, this will give the true length of a string,
	including non-printable characters. Use strlen_printable() if you do
	not want escape sequence characters included.
