NAME
	break_string - break a string at regular intervals
	
SYNOPSIS
	string break_string(string str|int foobar, int len, 
			    void|int indent|string indent)

DESCRIPTION
	This function breaks a continous string without newlines into a
	a string with newlines inserted at every `len':th character. 

	If `indent' is defined and is given as an integer, `indent' number
	of spaces are inserted after every newline. If `indent'	is a string 
	that string is inserted before every newline.

	If the first argument is an integer, the function simply returns 0.

	If ANSI_COLOR is defined, this function will not include ANSI color
	sequences when it computes line lengths.

	If USE_UTF8 is defined, this function will count the number of
	displayed columns to determine the break, rather than unicode
	characters (which can take up 1 or 2 columns), or bytes (UTF-8 is
	anywhere from 1-6 bytes per character).

	implode, explode, sprintf
