NAME
	terminal_colour - convert text codes into ANSI escape sequences

SYNOPSIS
	string terminal_colour(string str, int color_enabled = 1)

	str is the string to be converted.
	color_enabled is a flag on whether to convert the codes to ANSI escapes, or
	    just strip them out of the string without replacement.

DESCRIPTION
    This function converts a string containing codes a.k.a. Pinkfish codes
    to their equivalent ANSI escape sequence. Each code is surrounded by
    a "%%^^".

    Example:

        %%^^BLUE%%^^Snow continues to fall%%^^RESET%%^^
        becomes
        %^BLUE%^Snow continues to fall%^RESET%^

        If the color_enabled argument is set to false, the codes will be
        stripped, but no ANSI sequences will replace them.

        Use doubled characters to do an escape, like %%%^^^.

    The following codes are supported:
        Reset all current codes. Use this at the end of every string passed.:
            RESET

        Text colors:
            BLACK
            RED
            GREEN
            YELLOW
            BLUE
            MAGENTA
            CYAN
            WHITE
            ORANGE

        Additionally, numbered codes for unspecified colors can be used:
            FG_0 - FG_255

        Background colors:
            B_BLACK
            B_RED
            B_GREEN
            B_YELLOW
            B_BLUE
            B_MAGENTA
            B_CYAN
            B_WHITE

            BOLD
            FLASH
            ITALIC
            REVERSE

        Theme-specific codes (set via set_theme()):
            T_HIGH
            T_LIGHT
            T_NORM
            T_DARK
            T_VDARK

        Additionally, a few other codes are supported, but do nothing, to
          ease in porting:
            INITTERM
            WINDOW
            ENDTERM
            STATUS

NOTES
    At time of writing, this function assumes 256 color support, if
    there is any support at all.

    This efun is only defined if ANSI_COLOR was defined at compile time.

    Support for these codes are client-specific, and not all codes will
    work with every client.
